# Creative Theme for Jekyll

This is my Jekyll implementation of the creative theme for my website Copper Peak Limited.

Creative is a one page Bootstrap theme for creatives, small businesses, and other multipurpose uses.
The theme includes a number of rich features and plugins that you can use as a great boilerplate for your next Jekyll project!

Please see [Creative Theme](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/creative/) template by [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com).

See it live in action at <https://volny.github.io/creative-theme-jekyll/>

## To update the Creative Theme template in your project simply:

- Start by adding your info in `_config.yml`
- In `_layouts/front.html` reorder or remove section as you prefer.
