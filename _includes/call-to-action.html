                <p class="text-faded">I’m a highly experienced Operations Leader with over 30 years of Insurance and Reinsurance knowledge, covering predominantly Life/Health and Longevity lines of business but with some experience of General lines also.

I would say that I am a generalist or all-rounder at heart, which I find extremely useful as I have an abundance of experience gained on the business side as well as Technical and more IT focused skills picked up from many IT/projects over the years, which ultimately drew me to Business Analysis.

This array of knowledge stems from my inquisitive nature and determination to understand the hows? and whys? of a business.  With working experience in most functions within a company now, it’s no surprise that I have developed deep collaboration and operational skills over time.

As a Leader in a Head of Operations role, I found working to develop others and coaching them on how to look beyond their own responsibilities, particularly rewarding.  Listening to their combined ideas and taking the journey together so that we could understand how we could best add value really made a huge difference to enabling change and improving processes.

This proved invaluable as I led the transformation of what was an administration team to a multi-disciplined operations department and onto Global Business Lead on an SAP development and implementation project.

I’m now working with clients who require a skilled operations professional with solid experience in developing teams and consistent processes, to help them enable operational growth.
